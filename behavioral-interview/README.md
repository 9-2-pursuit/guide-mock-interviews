# Behavioral Interview Pre-Reading

## Intro

A behavioral interview has two parts

- The general impression you make
- Answering a behavioral question

## General

There are some things you can easily do to demonstrate your genuine interest in a role:

- Be on time and prepared
- Look professional
- Have good energy

### Being on Time and Prepared

In order to ensure being on time, you should actually arrive early.

If you are going to a physical location

- Be sure to plan to arrive at least 15 minutes ahead of time
- You can stop by a nearby cafe or simply wait in the building lobby
- Use your extra time
  - Use the bathroom
  - Check your appearance
  - Put your phone/laptop on do not disturb
  - Check that you have everything ready to go
    - Laptop
    - Pen/pencil, paper
    - Copies of your resume (even though this is becoming outdated, it doesn't hurt to have this)

If you are doing a remote interview, make sure your computer is ready to go

- Choose a location where you
  - Can be sure the internet connection is stable
  - It is quiet
  - You can sit comfortably
- Your phone and other notifications are silenced
- Extra programs and tabs closed
- Test audio and video on your computer and with whatever app they are using (zoom, google meetings etc.)
- If you will be using a video app, or other apps that you are unfamiliar with, take some time to get familiar with the basics (how to mute/unmute, turn video on/off)
- Make sure you are plugged in or have enough battery

- Make sure you have good lighting. Interviewers should be able to clearly see your face
- Your background should be simple or blurred
- Your laptop camera is positioned in a way that you can look (nearly) directly at it, this gives the illusion that you are making eye contact with your interviewers

### Look Professional

Whether your interview is in person or over video, your interviewers should remember you and not what you wore.

Keep it simple and neat. Choose clothes that fit properly and you feel good wearing.

Avoid trying:

- New haircuts the day before (at least a week, in case it doesn't work out as you'd hoped/you have time to correct)
- New lotions/fragrances/grooming routines the day of, if you are committed to updating your routine, practice it several times before your interview

### Have Good Energy

We all cope with feelings of anxiety differently. We may

- Be a nervous talker
- Shut down and only give single word answers
- Excessively fidget
- Slouch and avoid eye contact

These kinds of coping mechanisms can come across negatively in an interview. You can work on improving how you interact on an interview when feeling nervous.

You should aim to focus your energy on

- Being open
  - Activity listen
  - Ask questions
  - Look straight ahead (not at the floor/keyboard) most of the time, if you are in a physical space, look around
  - Make eye contact
- Have positive body language

The way to work on these things is to practice.

You can practice by:

- Using a mirror
- Record a video of yourself and watch it back
- As a friend or family member to ask you some sample questions

Though the above activities may feel unpleasant, they can really help you identify where you struggle and what you need to work on.

## Behavioral Interview Questions

### What are Behavioral Interview Questions

Behavioral questions use past behavior to predict future behavior.

Behavioral questions tend to start with

- Have you ever ...
- Describe ...
- How did you handle ...
- Give me an example of ...
- Tell me about a time ...

And they usually are looking for an example of something that was one of these six options:

- Best/worst
- Success/failure
- Effective/ineffective

These questions are trying to draw out how you are with (in no particular order)

- Teamwork
- Motivation
- Prioritization
- Time management
- Initiative
- Conflict resolution
- Problem solving
- Adaptability
- Leadership

### How to Answer Behavioral Questions

You want to find the sweet spot of giving enough detail and not talking too much to get to the answer.

You also want to have some situations and your response to talk about in mind. But don't memorize answers. Coming across as canned (predetermined/rehearsed/memorized) will be perceived negatively.

It may seem like this each question requires a unique approach, but you can follow a formula to help guide you to answer any of these questions.

### STAR Method

The STAR method is a way to organize the way you answer these questions that will make sure your answer covers all the salient points and allows you to have an answer that is short and impactful.

1. Situation
   - A brief description of the context
     - Who, what, where, when, and how
1. Task
   - Explain what you had to do
     - What were the specific challenges
     - What were the constraints (deadlines, resources etc.)
1. Action
   - What actions did you take to complete the task
   - Be sure to highlight your traits without needing to state them
     - initiative, dedication, teamwork, etc.
1. Result
   - How did it turn out?
   - If it is possible to quantify with numbers (We were able to reduce costs by 10%), then be sure to do so

If you are asked a question that doesn't seem to match you can work your way through a similar example or ask if you should approach the situation hypothetically.

### Extra Tips

- Be sure to keep the description of the situation brief and really focus on the action.
- Focus on what you did, not your team, not others
- Diplomatic in your responses, the details of your situation should illuminate where the problem was coming from
  - Avoid
    - I worked with all incompetent people who didn't care about the job
  - Lean into
    - I was on a team where missing deadlines happened weekly for most of my teammates

### How to Prepare

It's really important to not memorize an answer. When thinking of your own examples and responses, you can prepare by creating a table and using key-words and phrases, then, practice building the rest of your response on the fly. You should reference this table before an interview to jog your memory, but otherwise allow your responses to come naturally.

|      Example of       | Situation | Task | Action | Result | Trait Demonstration |
| :-------------------: | :-------: | :--: | :----: | :----: | :-----------------: |
|      Best/Worst       |           |      |        |        |                     |
|    Success/Failure    |           |      |        |        |                     |
| Effective/Ineffective |           |      |        |        |                     |

For trait demonstration, use the following list and make sure you have enough stories to cover these (a story can demonstrate multiple traits)

- Teamwork
- Motivation
- Prioritization
- Time management
- Initiative
- Conflict resolution
- Problem solving
- Adaptability
- Leadership
