## Review

At this point, you should have had some experience doing technical interviews with your peers and instructors.

Let's take some time to review and refine.

First, get ready to take some notes.

Take general notes on pointers, then take some time to write down what you do similarity and what you think you do well and what you need improvement working on.

Be ready to work on the things you have identified for your next mock interview.

## Coping with Feelings

Doing a technical interview can feel very anxiety-inducing, but you can do some things to help you prepare to manage your anxiety.

1. Feeling anxious is normal, for an interview it's a symptom of caring, don't be too hard on yourself if you feel anxious
1. Instead of telling yourself you feel anxious, [tell yourself that you feel excited](https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/485297/turn-anxiety-into-excitement/)
1. Let yourself excited for an interview! An interview is a performance, like speaking in public or singing or acting. You can get yourself ready by coming up with a phrase like [Fired up! Ready to go!](https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/513629/fired-up-ready-to-go/) to help you feel more confident and channel the right energy
1. Listen to music that helps you feel confident right before going in
1. Practice some [power poses](https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_may_shape_who_you_are)

No matter the outcome, realize that you will come out of it with experience and more knowledge than you had before. Each time you interview you will get something out of it that makes you a better coder and a better interviewee.
