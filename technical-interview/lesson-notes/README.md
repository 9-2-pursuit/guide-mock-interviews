# Technical Interview Lesson Notes

## Learning Objectives

- Review strategies for technical interviews

- Watch this video together: Watch this [Amazon Coding Sample Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjZpZ_wcYFg)

Use this rubric to discuss the interview and how the interviewee demonstrated the things that are being measured

## Rate your peer on the following criteria

1. Understanding the Prompt

   - Asks clarifying questions
   - Verifies assumptions (e.g. “would input ever be null?”, “would input ever be larger than a 32-bit int?”)
   - Demonstrates understanding w/ example inputs & outputs (and/or a diagram)

1. Designing a Solution

   - Identifies multiple high-level approaches (e.g. brute force vs. more efficient solutions)
   - Determines time & space complexity of each high-level approach
   - Selects appropriate data structure(s) and/or programming approach (e.g. iterative vs. recursive)
   - Plans out all steps of algorithm (in written words or pseudocode) before coding

1. Implementing a Solution
   - Writes valid, syntactically correct code for the full algorithm (unless the interviewer cuts them off early)
   - Uses proper indentation to make code readable
   - Selects descriptive names for variables/functions that follow standard casing conventions
   - Manually tests code by verifying output for sample inputs
   - Able to track down bugs effectively without resorting to “guessing” what is wrong
   - Solution handles edge cases
1. Presentation

   - Verbalizes thought process throughout
   - Uses sufficient vocal volume
   - Maintains positive tone and body language throughout
   - Utilizes all available whiteboard space, or includes ample comments if coding remotely
